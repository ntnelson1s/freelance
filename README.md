> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
Fully ready with dev hot server and such. Booya. Until Alibaba component lib
comes out, better to build your own components TBH. vue methodology has you do 
this anyways (angular's dream) and the components out there have shoddy APIs, worse
than just using the awesomeness of current HTML5/CCS3.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
